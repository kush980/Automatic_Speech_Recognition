analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 3.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 8.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, SIL_S accounts for 97.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,34.0,92) frames.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,35.7,25) frames.
At utterance end, SIL_S accounts for 92.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (58,60.8,127) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 8.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (108,1387.5,129) frames.
Overall, SIL_S accounts for 80.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,47.4,111) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 19.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (51,102.7,125) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 34.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 25.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 21.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (50,58.5,121)
