analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 5.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 9.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, SIL_S accounts for 95.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,33.3,79) frames.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 5.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,33.0,38) frames.
At utterance end, SIL_S accounts for 91.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (56,59.6,126) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 9.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (108,1246.9,129) frames.
Overall, SIL_S accounts for 81.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,47.8,111) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 18.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (52,103.7,127) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 33.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 24.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 21.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (50,58.3,121)
