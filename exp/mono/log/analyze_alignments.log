analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 4.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 9.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, SIL_S accounts for 96.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,32.8,79) frames.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 4.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,36.5,38) frames.
At utterance end, SIL_S accounts for 91.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (54,60.7,128) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 9.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (93,1235.3,129) frames.
Overall, SIL_S accounts for 80.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,48.2,114) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 19.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (48,98.8,119) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 33.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 24.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 21.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (48,55.0,114)
