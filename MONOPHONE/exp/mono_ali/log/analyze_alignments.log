analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 4.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 9.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, SIL_S accounts for 96.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,34.3,98) frames.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 4.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,28.8,25) frames.
At utterance end, SIL_S accounts for 91.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (58,61.9,128) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 9.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (98,1231.2,129) frames.
Overall, SIL_S accounts for 80.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,48.0,111) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 19.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (47,98.6,122) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 33.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 24.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 22.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (47,55.5,121)
